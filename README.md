## Vanguard Digital Transformation Project - A/B Test Results

#### **Context**: Focusing on user centered design and to ensure that our client will have the most fluid and easiest experience while using our online process, we conducted this research and analysis. 

#### **Datasets**: The data used on this project is on the "CSV files folder" which contains:

1. **df_final_demo.csv**: clients' demographic data, such as age, gender, tenure year and others.
2. **df_final_web_data_pt_1.csv, df_final_web_data_pt_2.csv**: A/B test results
3. **df_final_web_data_merged.csv**: merge of part 1 and part 2 web data files.
4. **df_final_experiment_clients.csv**: identification of clients that participated of the A/B test (control/test groups).

#### **Notebooks**: Our code is divided in three Jupyter Notebook files:

1. **eda_clientsdemo.ipynb**: exploratory data analysis of clients' age, tenure years and balance.
2. **Vanguard_Digital_Transformation_notebook.ipynb**: KPI's definition and calculation.
3. **hypothesis_tests**: statistical analysis of the results obtained for the chosen KPI's.

The requirements for running the code are available in the requirements.txt file.
